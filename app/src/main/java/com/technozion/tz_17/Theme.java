With a scythe and an hour glass, the former being less fatal than the latter, he treaded along the only direction he knew. He was omnipresent, butchering lives and destroying souls. The dimensions to him were frivolous, so he created the fourth one. A toy for many, the hour glass to him was a tool, to control and manipulate his only child. He thus became the most powerful and feared entity there ever was.\n" +

Be nice to him, and he may even let you peek into the future." );
